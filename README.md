# dto-example-doco

Example documentation for the technology stacks used by the DTO.

READMEs are important because:

 - they help new people to your project get up and running quickly
 - they help outsiders contribute to the projects
 - they give outsiders context about what we're building, and why

There are `README` templates for each of the technology stacks in use at the DTO.

Please copy and paste, and flavour to taste.
